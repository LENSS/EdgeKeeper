This directory contains the tested source code to get the required jar file for Android system.  
I copied the gigapaxos code version 1.0.06 and GNS branch android_lib. These two code branches are compatible.


First we need to run ant command in the gigapaxos. Then copy gigapaxos-1.0.05.jar file to the lib folder of GNS. Then running the ant command gives us the gnsclient-android-1.19.15.jar. 


USE GNS-client-code-with-android for the GNSService. It contains the new code regarding account creation with certificate
